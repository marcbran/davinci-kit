# Unofficial davinci-kit

A collection of practical tools designed to automate workflows in DaVinci Resolve.

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with DaVinci Resolve or Blackmagic Design.

It is a personal initiative created to explore AI-assisted coding.
While the tool functions as intended, the codebase is experimental and lacks refinement.

Use at your own discretion. It is not recommended for use in critical or production environments.

## Available tools

Currently there are two tools available:

1. [davinci-cli](davinci-cli/README.md)
   A small CLI tool that can be used to interact with DaVinci Resolve

2. [davinci-jsonnet](davinci-jsonnet/README.md)
   A jsonnet library that can be used to write compositions for the Fusion page in DaVinci Resolve
